### 1.  Introduction to the System  ###
The website created for the Final Part of the PROG6212 POE will help users(Preferably students) organize their studying by giving them an estimated amount of 
study hours that should be done per modules/subjects they have entered into the system. The website will allow students that use it to create an account, log in, show
their modules/subjects with the individual study hours and also allow them to update the study hours and modules/subjects they are doing.

### 2. How to open the program ###
You open this application by having Visual Studio installed and having the correct certificates and features installed.
